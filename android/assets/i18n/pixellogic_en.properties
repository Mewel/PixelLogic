tutorial.status1={COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}Welcome to {COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}PIXELLOGIC!{COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}{WAIT=.5} This game is all about solving pixel art puzzles. {WAIT=.5}Lets have some fun :)
tutorial.status11={COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}Perfect! {COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}Are you ready to learn something new?
tutorial.status13={COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}So, what to do here? :)
tutorial.status14a={COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}Awesome{COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}! Lets see the columns. They work just like the rows.
tutorial.status14b={COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}Looks like those two columns are already solved. We should block the remaining pixels!
tutorial.status15={COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}Block the other column!
tutorial.status16a={COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}Perfect{COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}! When you block pixels you can't accidentally draw on them. Lets move on to the next column.
tutorial.status16b={COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}That looks easy. I think you can do it :).
tutorial.status17a={COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}Great! {COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}Lets see the last two columns.
tutorial.status17b={COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}Here's something new. {COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}Separate numbers {COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}show different segments. Lets see how it works.
tutorial.status18={COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}Separate numbers needs some {COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}space{COLOR=TEXT_COLOR} between them. It's not always one pixel, it can vary. Now finish the level :)
tutorial.status19a={COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}Awesome{COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}, you did it!!!
tutorial.status19b={COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}You learned everything you need to know.  To rerun the tutorial click on the question mark at the top right corner of the next page.
tutorial.status19c={COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}I recommend starting with the campaign. Have fun with {COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}PixelLogic{COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}!
tutorial.status5={COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}The {COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}4 {COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}in this row means that {COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}all {COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}pixels have to be filled.
tutorial.status7={COLOR=TEXT_COLOR}Now its your turn :). Fill the next row!
tutorial.status8={COLOR=MAIN_COLOR}Perfect!{COLOR=TEXT_COLOR} I think you can solve this level now :).
